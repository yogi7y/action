# Inbox (V1)

Quick capture should be frictionless. Act like a global inbox for all things in the app. Things like:

- Create a task quickly.
- Adding a note quickly.
  > can only think of these two right now.

## User Flow

- As a user I should be able to quickly capture information like tasks, pages etc.
- I should also see a list of thing which I've captured.
- I should be able to come back and organise it later.
- I should also have a clean slate to start of a day so I'm not overwhelmed if there are a lot of unorganised items.
- I should be able to capture task from anywhere in the app.

## UI UX

- An inbox icon on home screen towards the top right. (Inbox count good to have)
- A FAB for quick capture. Experience will be same, it'll open a textfield towards the top, support natural language, etc.
- There'll be 2 tabs to group by tasks and pages.
- Inside a single tab we'll have a list of inbox items (unorganised items created < 24hrs ago>) followed by another section of unorganised tasks.
- Some common action on swipe. Decide later.
